# Run gulp in a containter
#
# This script runs a command container, using gulp in a specifiec folder
#
# The container tries to run gulp $@ in a specified path, which should contain
# a gulpfile.
#
# Note that the folder must be in the app/ path, as this is mapped into 
# the container, at a predictable point:
#   host: ./app  -> container: /app/project
# So that any subpath is easily remapped:
#   host: ./app/web/themes/custom/MyTheme -> container: /app/project/web/themes/custom/MyTheme
#
# You can easily alter this, as long as you are aware of how files are
# mapped in the container.
