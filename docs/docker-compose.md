# Docker-Compose on Wundertools

We decided to try to rely on docker-compose for container management.

- docker-compose is a docker supported tool, that is becoming an industrt standard
- docker-compose uses a yml syntax file that is supported by other tools
- all we need to rely on is the yml config (the tool is irrelevant)
